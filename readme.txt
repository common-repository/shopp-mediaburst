Merchants who have a WordPress e-commerce store are notified of new orders via a text message to their mobile phone through Mediaburst.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Shopp](http://shopplugin.net) with [Mediaburst](http://www.mediaburst.co.uk).

This plugin adds text message notifications for new orders.

After checkout, the merchant will receive a text message with new order information.

This process occurs in the background without needing action from the customer.

NOTICE: Mediaburst has renamed their SMS Gateway to Clockwork. Learn more about the [Clockwork API](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shopp-clockwork/)
